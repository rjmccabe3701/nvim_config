# NeoVim Configuration for Linux Kernel Development

This is a lua based, bootstrap-able NeoVim Configuration for C development (for example, Linux Kernel or Qemu).

## 1. Prerequisite

1. Install [NeoVim](https://neovim.io/). Refer to [NeoVim Installation Wiki](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/master/INSTALL.md)
2. Install [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep). Usually distributions already have it.
3. [Nerd Fonts](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts) are pretty icon fonts. It is better to install to have a good experience.
4. Have access to github.com. Proxy may need to be configured if sitting in internal network.

## 2. Install

1. Do following to cleanup previous nvim related configurations
```bash
rm -rf ~/.local/share/nvim
rm -rf ~/.local/state/nvim
rm -rf ~/.cache/nvim
```
2. Clone this repo to ~/.config/nvim
3. Launch 'nvim'. This will download all the necessary plugins automatically.
4. Quit nvim, and relaunch nvim. That's it.

## 3. LSP and Language Servers

This configuration leverages [LSP](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) and Language servers to do auto-completion, go-to-definition, references, etc.

Refer to [server_configurations.md](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/blob/master/doc/server_configurations.md) on various language servers.

This configuration uses plugin [mason](https://github.com/williamboman/mason.nvim) to manage language servers. Use ':Mason' command to bring up mason interface.

Two language servers 'clangd' and 'lua_ls' are automatically installed. Use ':Mason' to bring up mason and install other language servers.

Sometimes language servers may fail to install. Usually that is because of environment issues, such as proxy is not configured properly.

### 3.1. Clangd and compile_commands.json

If it is C repo, the file compile_commands.json is needed for language server 'clangd' to work.

#### 3.1.1. Linux Kernel

Run 'scripts/clang-tools/gen_compile_commands.py' after kernel compiling. This will generate compile_commands.json in the top directory.

After that, editing c file in the kernel repo will make clangd start to act as a language server.

#### 3.1.2. Qemu

Qemu automatically generate a compile_commands.json in its build/ directory, so no extra actions is needed for Qemu.
